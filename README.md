# AguilarFMiniChallenge4

The program will ask the user to input two numbers. Will include data validation.
The terminal will output whether the values are greater than, less than, or equal to each other.

Peer Reviewed By: Brandon Le - So the program is able to give me the proper inputs for when the numbers are equal to one another and when they are less than or greater than one another. There is data validation for the number inputs so that works properly. The game is able to play again also, but I noticed that you can end the game by pressing enter or typing in numbers or any keys and not just by typing end. Other than that good job on the project very nice!
